Using Music Blocks
------------------

Music Blocks is designed to run in a browser. It is derived from
Turtle Blocks JS which can be found
[here](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs). You can run it
directly from index.html, from the
[github](walterbender.github.io/musicblocks) repo, or by setting up a
local server.

See [Using Music
Blocks](http://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks/tree/master/documentation) and [Music Blocks Guide](http://github.com/walterbender/musicblocks/tree/master/guide)

Music Blocks is a fork of TurtleArtJS created by Walter
Bender. (Turtle Blocks JS has many
[contributors](https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/graphs/contributors)).

Devin Ulibarri has contributed functional and user-interface
designs. Many of his contributions were inspired by the music
education ideas, representations and practices (e.g. aspects of
matrix, musical cups) developed and published by Dr. Lawrence Scripp
with whom Devin studied at New England Conservatory and for whom he
worked at Affron Scripp & Associates, LLC.
